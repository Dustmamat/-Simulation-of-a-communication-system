##  Projects

### **Project 1: Simulation of a Communication System**

####  Overview
This project simulates a communication system that transmits and processes two audio signals. It includes:
- Analysis of audio signals in the time and frequency domains.
- Noise removal using filtering techniques.
- Multiplexing strategies to share a channel with minimal interference.
- Signal recovery using demodulation and filtering.

####  Key Features
1. **Audio Signal Analysis**:
   - Time and frequency domain visualization.
   - Bandwidth calculation.

2. **Disturbance Removal**:
   - **Bessel Low-Pass Filter**: Removes high-frequency noise while preserving signal integrity.
   - **Narrow Frequency Rejection Filter**: Targets specific noise frequencies without affecting the desired signal.

3. **Channel Sharing via Multiplexing**:
   - Amplitude modulation (AM) used to transmit two audio signals in parallel.
   - Selection of optimal carrier frequencies to prevent interference.

4. **Signal Recovery**:
   - Demodulation using a local carrier and filtering.
   - Performance comparison of different low-pass filters.

####  Performance Metrics
The efficiency of filtering and demodulation is measured using the **Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)**. A higher SIR indicates better signal quality.

### **Project 2: Lab 1 - Analog Signal Transmission over Digital Channel**

####  Overview
This project develops a numerical simulator to evaluate the performance of transmitting analog signals over a digital channel. The simulation analyzes the impact of quantization and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) characteristics on signal integrity.

- **Real Signal Testing**: Application to real music signals with non-uniform distributions
- **Huffman Coding**: Data compression technique for improved transmission efficiency

####  Key Results
- **SNR Performance**:
  - Quantization-limited SNR: ~30 dB (5 bits)
  - Channel-limited regime follows SNR ‚àù 1/(4P‚Çë)
- **Music Signal**: 10.26 dB degradation compared to uniform signal
- **Huffman Coding**: Achieved coding gain of ~1.4
- **Source Entropy**: H = 3.55 bits/symbol

####  Theoretical Foundation
Total SNR for uniform quantization: SNR = M¬≤ / [1 + 4P‚Çë(M¬≤ - 1)]
where M = 2‚Åø (n = number of bits), P‚Çë = bit error probability
